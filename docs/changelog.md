# Change log
Although not too exhaustive, this page contains some detail on what we have been done on each version.

## 0.3
Added
  - **Basic Auth** validator with static and dynamic user list (based on Kubernetes secrets).
  - **Web console**. Right now you can see your config and performance, but no changes can be done to Oberkorn configuration via console.
  - Authorizators now have its own **service accounts**, and the controllers give them permissions (role/rolebinsing) as needed.
  - Basic Auth of 'secret' store type now support password changes.
  - We have refactored the way validators are instantiated. Now the controller creates an instance of a validator and after that it calls the 'init' function of the newly created validator, which must return a boolean indicating if the initialization is correct (so the validator is usable).

## 0.2
Added:
  - **Keycloak** validator.
  - **Basic Auth** validator.
  - **Custom** validator.
  - **Google** validator.
  - Automatic version creation.
  - Finally, we implemented behaviours (onfalse & ontrue).

Changes:
  - No need to use config maps for configuring the authorizators (we now use annotations)

Correction:
  - Some minor optimizations on log management
