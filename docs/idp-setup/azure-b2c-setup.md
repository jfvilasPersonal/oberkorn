# Azure B2C setup
Azure B2c is what I usually define as an SD, a Subdirectory Active. When you work with it you notice it is like an AD (Active Directory) but with limited functionality and added functionality, like userflows, language settings or login form tuning. We'll guide you on creating a basic B2C service for testing Oberkorn. What you will do is:

  1. Create a B2C tenant
  2. Create a user
  3. Create an userflow for signing in
  4. Gather all needed info to configure Oberkorn
  5. Test your B2C service in the demo application.

## Prerequisites
You are exptected to have an Azure susbscription and privileges enough (like contributor or owner) to create resources. 

## Create B2C tenant

## Create a user

## Create an userflow

## Gather configuration info

## Test
